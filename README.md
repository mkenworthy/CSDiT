Several extended deep and complex eclipses have been seen towards otherwise unremarkable main sequence stars. This paper summarises the light curves that have been identified by the [ASASSN transients](https://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/asassn/transients.html), and the photometry was cleaned and aligned to produce the resultant curves, which form the basis for further study.

The ASASSN transient list should be referenced with [Shappee et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...788...48S/abstract).
